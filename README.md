# RAG-Enhanced LLM Tutor

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) Tutor system. It leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to provide an intelligent tutoring experience. The system combines the power of pre-trained language models with a dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to generate contextually relevant and informative responses.

## Key Features

- **RAG Architecture**: Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model, enhancing the base LLM with retrieved contextual information.
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Utilizes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning of the LLM.
- **Vector Store**: Incorporates a FAISS-based vector store for efficient similarity search in the knowledge base.
- **Modular Design**: Employs a multi-file structure for clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Includes multiple evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.
- **Interactive Tutoring Mode**: Provides an interactive command-line interface for real-time tutoring sessions.

## System Architecture

The system is structured into several key components:

1. **Data Processing**: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
2. **Model**: Implements the core LLM and RAG models.
3. **Training**: Manages the training process, including LoRA adaptation.
4. **Evaluation**: Provides comprehensive model evaluation capabilities.
5. **Inference**: Implements the interactive tutoring interface.
6. **Utilities**: Includes logging and vector store functionalities.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language Model**: Transformer-based causal language model (e.g., GPT architecture)
- **Retrieval Model**: FAISS-based vector store with SentenceTransformer encodings
- **Training**: AdamW optimizer with linear learning rate scheduler
- **Fine-tuning**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore
- **Vector Similarity**: L2 distance in the FAISS index

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rag-enhanced-llm-tutor.git
cd rag-enhanced-llm-tutor

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure the system by editing `config.yaml` with appropriate paths and hyperparameters.

4. Prepare your training, evaluation, and knowledge base datasets.

## Usage

The system supports three primary modes of operation:

1. **Training**:
python main.py --mode train --config config.yaml
2. **Evaluation**:
python main.py --mode evaluate --config config.yaml
3. **Inference** (Interactive Tutoring):
python main.py --mode infer --config config.yaml

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file contains all necessary configurations:

- Data paths
- Model parameters
- Training hyperparameters
- Evaluation settings
- Logging configurations
- Inference parameters

## Extending the System

The modular design allows for easy extension:

- Add new model architectures in `model/`
- Implement additional training techniques in `training/`
- Introduce new evaluation metrics in `evaluation/`
- Enhance the vector store capabilities in `utils/vectorstore.py`

## Performance Considerations

- The RAG model's performance is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of the knowledge base.
- LoRA fine-tuning allows for efficient adaptation of the base LLM without full fine-tuning.
- The FAISS index enables fast similarity search but requires careful consideration of index type based on the dataset size and dimensionality.

## Limitations and Future Work

- The current implementation does not support distributed training.
- Integration with more advanced retrieval techniques (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, GraphRAG) could further enhance performance.
- Implementing a web-based interface would improve accessibility for end-users.
